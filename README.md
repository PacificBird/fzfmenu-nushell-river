## A nushell-based fzf dmenu-like setup for the River compositor &amp; Wezterm
A simple and clean runner menu using only the software you already have installed! You'll need `fzf`, `river`, `wezterm`, `nushell`, and `dex` for starting desktop files.

I have included some comments in the files marking what you should customize.
The only requirement is to change the filepaths in the river config to match your user name.
A small change in the nushell script will allow you to use a different compositor to spawn windows, so you can reuse most of this config to adapt to the window manager of your choice.
